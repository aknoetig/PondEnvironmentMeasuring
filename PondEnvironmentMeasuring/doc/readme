Pond Environment Measuring Application

An Application for accessing the collected Measurements of the Pond Environment Measuring WSN.

Features:
  * Connecting to Collecting Nodes on specifiable IP Address and Port Number
  * Showing read in CSV file's content
  * Exporting loaded CSV contents to Hard Drive


There are two Executable Java Programms in this Project:

  - The Application: app.Main
  - A Test Server: testserver.TestServer
  
The Test Server can be used to test the Application without a corresponding WSN. 
The Server provides a small CSV File to be read in by the Application. The Server runs on port 6789.
The Application is initially set to be connecting to 127.0.0.1:6789, so by default it tries to connect with 
the running Test Server on the same Machine. To connect to an actual Collecting Node,
its Address has to be specified.
